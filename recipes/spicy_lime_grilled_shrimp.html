    </p>


    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
   
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons Cajun seasoning (such as Emeril's Essence)</li>
      <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp (30-40 per pound)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong> Step 1 – </strong>use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to
        get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2 – </strong>just before cooking steaks,
        sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Preheat the pan on
        medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3 – </strong>add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes
        until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their
        sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4 – </strong> melt in butter with
        quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic
        butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).
