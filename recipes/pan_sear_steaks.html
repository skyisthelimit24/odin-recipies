    <h2>How to make Pan Sear Steaks:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong> Pat dry – </strong>use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to
        get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season generously – </strong>just before cooking steaks,
        sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Preheat the pan on
        medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sear steaks – </strong>add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes
        until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their
        sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add butter and aromatics – </strong> melt in butter with
        quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic
        butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Remove steak </strong>and rest 10 minutes before slicing against
        the grain.
