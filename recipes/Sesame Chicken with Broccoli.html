      <li>1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon cooking oil of choice, divided</li>

      <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>

      <li>1/3 cup hoisin sauce</li>

      <li>1/3 cup rice vinegar</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon sambal oelek, or to taste</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>

      <li>1/2 cup carrots, cut into matchsticks</li>

      <li>1/2 cup sliced shallots</li>

      <li>4 cups fresh broccoli florets</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong> Step 1 – </strong>Place chicken pieces in a bowl. Sprinkle with
        cornstarch, salt, and white pepper. Toss chicken to coat evenly and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2 – </strong>Heat 1 teaspoon cooking oil in a small
        nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook,
        stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3 – </strong>Stir in soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar,
        sambal oelek, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring, about
        1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4 – </strong> Heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat
        in a large nonstick skillet or wok until very hot. Add chicken pieces
        carefully to the hot oil. Cook, stirring, until chicken pieces are
        lightly browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes total. The chicken pieces
        will cause spattering, so be sure to use a long-handled spoon or other
        utensil to move the chicken around.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5 – </strong> Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken from
        the skillet and add the remaining 2 tablespoons cooking oil. Add
        carrots, shallots, and broccoli, and stir quickly and continually, 3 to
        4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6 – </strong> Stir in prepared sauce, and cook until the
        vegetables are as tender as you like, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 7 – </strong> Place cornstarch in a small bowl and stir in
        1 tablespoon soy sauce. Keep stirring until there are no lumps. Add
        cornstarch slurry to the skillet and rapidly stir until well combined.
        Return chicken pieces and cook, stirring often, until heated through, 2
        to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 8 – </strong> Remove from heat, sprinkle with sesame seeds,
        and serve hot.
